Varad Raj Agrawal — Portfolio

Hey! I’m Varad, and this is my personal portfolio — a small corner of the internet where I’m showcasing what I’ve built, what I’ve learned, and how I’m growing as a developer.

I made this project not just to show my skills, but to **document my journey**. I’ve always believed that the best way to learn is by building. That’s something I strongly connect with from what I’ve seen about Polaris School of Technology.


 What's in here

- A clean, minimal portfolio site built using HTML and Tailwind CSS.
- An “About Me” section where I’ve written what drives me.
- My tech stack visualized with styled cards (Java, Python, Web).
- A few **projects** I’ve worked on — including a Discord bot that automates news.
- An **interactive grid** section that’s inspired by GitHub contributions (with pixel art mode too).
- Proper **contact links**, styled and accessible.
- Custom animations and background effects.



 Why I built this

I’ve seen a lot of portfolios that look flashy but feel empty. I wanted mine to feel like **me** — simple, direct, and driven.  

Also, after discovering PST, I’ve been drawn to their culture of execution, feedback, and community. This site is part of my attempt to align with that. No fluff, just action.

> I don’t know everything. But I’m building, learning, and improving — one project at a time.

 Notes

This project is personal. I didn’t follow any template, and everything was written from scratch. If you're reading this and you’re from Polaris — just know I’m putting in the work, and I’m here for the long game.

Thanks for checking it out. 🙂
